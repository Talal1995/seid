The Syrian diaspora grew into a powerhouse of expertise, yet many longed to contribute where their knowledge mattered most, back home in Syria.",
      "part2": "Despite the distance, Syrians stayed connected, forming strong communities wherever they went. Then, on December 8, 2024, history shifted. The old regime fell, and for the first time in decades, Syrians reclaimed their homeland. Across the diaspora, a single question united Syrians.",
